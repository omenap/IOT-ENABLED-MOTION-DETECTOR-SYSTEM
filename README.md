# IOT-ENABLED-MOTION-DETECTOR-SYSTEM
This system is basically a security system that detects motion and with the aid of IOT sends a string of data to a database defining to the user the state of the environment of the system.
This information is then retrived from the database to a mobile app that was developed to aid easy view for the user. 
For testing purposes, an MIT app was developed and used for testing, and a google firebase real time database was also created.
